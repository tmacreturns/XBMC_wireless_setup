If you check out the source from CVS run
  ./autogen.sh then follow as below, except you don't need to run 
  ./configure.

To compile the source:

  ./configure MAKE=gmake 
  make
  make check
  make install  # may have to do this as root 


If you have problems linking libcdio or libiso9660, see the BSD
section.  You might also try the option --without-versioned-libs. However
this option does help with the situtation described below so it is
preferred all other things being equal.


VCD dependency:
---------------
One thing that confuses people is the "dependency" on libvcdinfo from
vcdimager, while vcdimager has a dependency on libcdio.  This libcdio
dependency on vcdimager is an optional (i.e. not mandatory) dependency,
while the vcdimager dependency right now is mandatory. libvcdinfo is
used only by the utility program cd-info. If you want cd-info to use
the VCD reporting portion and you don't already have vcdimager
installed, build and install libcdio, then vcdimager, then configure
libcdio again and it should find libvcdinfo. 

People who make packages might consider making two packages, a libcdio
package with just the libraries (and no dependency on libvcdinfo) and
a libcdio-utils which contains cd-info and iso-info, cd-read,
iso-read. Should you want cd-info with VCD support then you'd add a
dependency in that package to libvcdinfo.

Another thing one can do is "make install" inside the library, or run
"configure --without-vcd-info --without-cddb" (since libcddb also has
an optional dependency on libcdio).

BSD
---

Unless you use --without-versioned-libs (not recommended), you need to
use GNU make which usually can be found under the name "gmake".

If you use another make you are likely to get problems linking libcdio
and libiso9660.


Solaris
-------

You may need to use --without-versioned-libs if you get a problem
building libcdio or libiso9660.

OS Support
---------------

Support for Operating Systems's other than GNU/Linux is really based
on the desire, ability and willingness of others to help out. To date
it's been almost zip. I use GNU/Linux so that probably works
best. Occasionally, I'll test on an old Solaris box I have. Steve
Shultz has done a great job making BSDI CD support look like GNU/Linux
and usually let's me know where I've blown things on BSDI. Derk-Jan
Hartman started Mac OSX, but that's not complete yet. Calls for help
in FreeBSD (NetBSD whatever) and Solaris have gone out but no one yet
seems all that interested. Maybe it's just as well. Microsoft support
is also meager. It works on my Windows 98 laptop sort of. Personally I
find it a drag to develop on Microsoft Operating Systems and have
spent far more time on this platform than I care for. If someone is
interested in fixing the Microsoft OS support great.
