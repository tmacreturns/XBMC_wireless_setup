# /etc/live-persistence.binds example
#
# If this file is present in the proper path, each uncommented not empty line
# will be treated as a directory which should not be made persistent and
# which it's content should be volatile.
#
# This is achieved by bind mounting on it a tmpfs clone of the directory specified

# Exclude some standard temporary paths
/tmp
/var/log
/var/cache
