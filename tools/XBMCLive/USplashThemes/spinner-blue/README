XBMC Splash - Black
====================

This is my 3rd attempt at a decent USplash theme for my linux XBMC HTPC (and possibly yours too :).

It cotains several resolutions:
1024x768
1280x720
1366x768
1280x1024
1440x900
1920x1080
1920x1200

Those might work depending on the use (and support for your vid card) of the UVESAFB kernel module.
On my system (Radeon 3850 and 17" LCD) I was able to use 1024x768 and 1280x1024.


Build Instructions
==================================================
For Ubuntu, you will need the following packages installed:
build-essential, libusplash-dev.

As it updates the initrd image, you'll need to work as root (or sudo).

1. extract the package.
2. make (or make -j2 -for a faster compile)
3. backup your current ubuntu usplash: sudo cp /usr/lib/usplash/usplash-theme-ubuntu.so ~/
4. replace it with your brand new xbmc usplash: sudo cp ./xbmc-splash.so /usr/lib/usplash/usplash-theme-ubuntu.so
5. update the initrd image: sudo update-initramfs -u
6. reboot
7. enjoy.
