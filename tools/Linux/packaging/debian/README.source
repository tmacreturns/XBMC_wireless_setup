The following is done to the upstream tarball or SVN checkout when creating
the orig tarball used in creating XBMC packages for Debian.

- libdvdcss is removed from xbmc/cores/dvdplayer/Codecs/libdvd/libdvdcss.
- The empty directories xbmc/cores/dvdplayer/Codecs/libDVDCSS and
  xbmc/cores/dvdplayer/Codecs/libdvdnav are removed.

Also, the upstream source version is appended with '~debN' where 'N' is some
integer. This is done to mark that the XBMC source in Debian is modified from
upstream.
