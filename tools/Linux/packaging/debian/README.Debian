XBMC for different Kernels and Architectures
--------------------------------------------

Currently, the configure scripts for XBMC is configured to only allow XBMC to
build on i386, amd64, powerpc, and powerpc64 on Linux, and i386 and powerpc on
Darwin. If you are able to build and run XBMC on other architectures and/or
kernels, please provide patches of configure.in and any other files you may have
modified to the Debian BTS.
